			<h2>Sokoban, with a maths twist!</h2>
			<p>
				The aim of the game is to fill all the target blocks (green outline), using all the number blocks (filled green)
			</p>
			<p class="controls">
			You're the red block. Move around using 
			<img src="images/letter-w-icon.png"/>, 
			<img src="images/letter-a-icon.png"/>, 
			<img src="images/letter-s-icon.png"/>, 
			<img src="images/letter-d-icon.png"/>
			
			on your keyboard. You can push the number blocks (filled green), but cannot walk through or push any other type of block.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are also math blocks, in the purply grey. These let you combine two number blocks by applying the operation indicated on the block. Push two number blocks onto a maths block to see it in action.
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember, you only win when all target blocks are filled, and all number blocks are used!
